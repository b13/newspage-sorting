# newspage-sorting
This extension adds automatic sorting of news pages inside a "newspage" module to the backend.

In order for this to work, simply select the "News" module type of a folder in the backend and create news inside of it.

By default news pages are sorted into new folders by year, month and day. 

The extension settings allow changing the sorting depth by disabling folders for each day, or month.
